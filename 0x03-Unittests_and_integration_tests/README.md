# Unit Tests Correction

This repository contains Python code and unit tests for practicing and validating backend concepts such as context managers, generators, decorators, and integration with external APIs.

## Structure

- `client.py`: Contains the `GithubOrgClient` class for interacting with the GitHub API.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for nested map access, JSON fetching, and memoization.
- `fixtures.py`: Sample data used for integration tests.
- `test_client.py`: Unit and integration tests for `client.py`.
- `test_utils.py`: Unit tests for `utils.py`.

## Features

- All test files start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Classes and test cases are implemented using Python's `unittest` framework.
- Decorators such as `@parameterized.expand` and `@patch` are used for test parametrization and mocking.
- Integration tests use fixtures and mock network calls.
- All tests are designed to pass with the provided code and fixtures.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install requests parameterized
   ```

2. **Run tests:**
   ```
   python test_utils.py
   python test_client.py
